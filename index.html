Such special rules shall conform as closely as possible to these Rules.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> Local authorities (like port authorities) can make their own special local rules for harbours, rivers, lakes, and inland waterways. But those local rules should be as close to these COLREGS rules as possible. Think of it like how your city might have extra traffic rules on top of the national driving rules.</div><h4>Rule 1(c) – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Government of any State with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes, or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights, shapes, or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape, or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> Governments can create extra lights, shapes, or whistle signals for warships traveling in groups (convoys) or fishing fleets. But these extra signals must look different enough so nobody confuses them with the standard COLREGS signals.</div><h4>Rule 1(d) – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> The IMO (International Maritime Organization) can create official "traffic lanes" on the ocean — like highways at sea where ships must travel in certain directions.</div><h4>Rule 1(e) – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a vessel of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect of that vessel.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> If a vessel has a special design (like an oil rig or a very unusual ship) and physically <em>can't</em> follow all the lighting/shape/sound rules exactly, its government decides what the closest possible alternative should be. The vessel must then follow that alternative.</div>`

The ship, the owner, the captain, and every crew member can all be held responsible if they fail to follow these rules. You also can't say "the rules didn't mention it" — if common sense and normal seafaring practice say you should do something, you must do it. No excuses.</div><h4>Rule 2(b) – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">In construing and complying with these Rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from these Rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> When following these rules, always pay attention to all dangers around you. Sometimes, in special situations, blindly following the rules could actually cause a collision. If that happens, you are allowed — even required — to break the rules to avoid immediate danger. Use your common sense! Safety comes first, always.</div><div class="kp"><strong>⚠️ Key Takeaway:</strong> Rule 2 is the "common sense" rule. It says: (1) Everyone is responsible, no excuses. (2) If following a rule would cause danger, you must deviate from the rule to stay safe. This is sometimes called the "Rule of Good Seamanship."</div>`

            content: `<h3>Rule 3 – General Definitions</h3><p>For the purpose of these Rules, except where the context otherwise requires:</p><h4>(a) "Vessel" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The word "vessel" includes every description of water craft, including non-displacement craft, WIG craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> A "vessel" means literally anything that floats and can carry people or cargo on water — ships, boats, kayaks, jet skis, hovercrafts, seaplanes sitting on water, wing-in-ground effect craft, everything.</div><h4>(b) "Power-driven vessel" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The term "power-driven vessel" means any vessel propelled by machinery.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> Any vessel using an engine to move. If the engine is running and pushing the ship, it's a power-driven vessel.</div><h4>(c) "Sailing vessel" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The term "sailing vessel" means any vessel under sail provided that propelling machinery, if fitted, is not being used.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> A vessel moving only by wind power using sails. If it has an engine but the engine is OFF and it's only using sails, it counts as a sailing vessel. But the moment the engine is turned ON (even if sails are also up), it becomes a power-driven vessel.</div><h4>(d) "Vessel engaged in fishing" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The term "vessel engaged in fishing" means any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls or other fishing apparatus which restrict manoeuvrability, but does not include a vessel fishing with trolling lines or other fishing apparatus which do not restrict manoeuvrability.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> A fishing vessel under COLREGS is one that is actively fishing with gear that makes it hard to steer or change direction (like big nets or trawls). A recreational fisherman with a simple fishing rod or trolling line does NOT count — because a fishing rod doesn't stop you from steering.</div><h4>(e) "Seaplane" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The word "seaplane" includes any aircraft designed to manoeuvre on the water.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> Any aircraft that can operate on water — floatplanes, flying boats, etc.</div><h4>(f) "Vessel not under command" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The term "vessel not under command" means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstance is unable to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> A vessel that has lost its ability to steer or control itself due to some unusual problem — like engine failure, broken steering, or crew incapacitation. It literally <em>cannot</em> get out of the way. This is NOT just a vessel that doesn't <em>want</em> to move — it <em>can't</em> move.</div><h4>(g) "Vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The term "vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre" means a vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to manoeuvre as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. The term "vessels restricted in their ability to manoeuvre" shall include but not be limited to:(i) a vessel engaged in laying, servicing or picking up a navigation mark, submarine cable or pipeline;(ii) a vessel engaged in dredging, surveying or underwater operations;(iii) a vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons, provisions or cargo while underway;(iv) a vessel engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft;(v) a vessel engaged in mine clearance operations;(vi) a vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to deviate from their course.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> A vessel that CAN still steer, but because of the job it's doing right now, it can't easily get out of the way. Examples: a ship laying underwater cables, a dredger digging the seabed, a ship transferring cargo to another ship while moving, an aircraft carrier launching planes, a minesweeper clearing mines, or a tugboat with a very heavy tow that can't turn easily.</div><h4>(h) "Vessel constrained by her draught" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The term "vessel constrained by her draught" means a power-driven vessel which, because of her draught in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water, is severely restricted in her ability to deviate from the course she is following.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> A ship that sits so deep in the water (heavy cargo) that the water beneath and around it is barely deep enough. It can't turn or change course without running aground. Think of a massive fully-loaded oil tanker in a shallow channel — it has almost no room underneath.</div><h4>(i) "Underway" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The word "underway" means that a vessel is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> A vessel is "underway" when it is NOT anchored, NOT tied to shore, and NOT stuck on the bottom. Important: "underway" does NOT necessarily mean moving! A vessel drifting with no anchor down is still "underway" even if it's not going anywhere.</div><h4>(j) "Length and breadth" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The words "length" and "breadth" of a vessel mean her length overall and greatest breadth.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> When the rules mention a ship's "length," they mean the total length from front to back (tip to tip). "Breadth" means the widest part of the ship.</div><h4>(k) "Vessels in sight of one another" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> Two vessels are "in sight" only when you can actually SEE the other vessel with your own eyes. Seeing it on radar does NOT count. If you can only detect it on radar but can't see it with your eyes, you are NOT "in sight of one another."</div><h4>(l) "Restricted visibility" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The term "restricted visibility" means any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms or any other similar causes.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> Any weather or condition that makes it hard to see — fog, mist, heavy rain, snow, sandstorms, smoke, haze, etc.</div><h4>(m) "Wing-in-Ground (WIG) craft" – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The term "Wing-in-Ground (WIG) craft" means a multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by utilizing surface-effect action.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> A special type of vehicle that flies very close to the water surface (usually just a few meters above), riding on a cushion of air trapped between its wings and the water. It's like a cross between a boat and a low-flying airplane.</div>`

Don't suddenly change course or speed — that would confuse the give-way vessel.</div><h4>Rule 17(a)(ii) – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The latter vessel may however take action to avoid collision by her manoeuvre alone, as soon as it becomes apparent to her that the vessel required to keep out of the way is not taking appropriate action in compliance with these Rules.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> BUT — if you (the stand-on vessel) can see that the give-way vessel is NOT doing what it should (not turning, not slowing down, not getting out of the way), you MAY take action yourself to avoid collision. You don't have to wait for disaster.</div><h4>Rule 17(b) – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">When, from any cause, the vessel required to keep her course and speed finds herself so close that collision cannot be avoided by the action of the give-way vessel alone, she shall take such action as will best aid to avoid collision.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> If things get so bad that the give-way vessel ALONE can't prevent the collision, the stand-on vessel MUST take action too. At this point, it's no longer optional — you are REQUIRED to do whatever it takes to avoid the crash. Both vessels must now work to avoid collision.</div><h4>Rule 17(c) – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">A power-driven vessel which takes action in a crossing situation in accordance with sub-paragraph (a)(ii) of this Rule to avoid collision with another power-driven vessel shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, not alter course to port for a vessel on her own port side.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> If you're the stand-on power vessel in a crossing situation and you decide to take action because the give-way vessel isn't doing its job: do NOT turn LEFT (to port) if the other vessel is on your left side. Turning left toward a vessel on your left could put you right in its path. Turn right (starboard) instead, or slow down.</div><h4>Rule 17(d) – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">This Rule does not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligation to keep out of the way.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> Even if the stand-on vessel has to take action, this DOESN'T let the give-way vessel off the hook. The give-way vessel is STILL obligated to get out of the way. Both vessels could be found at fault in a collision.</div><div class="kp"><strong>⚠️ The 3 Stages of Rule 17:</strong><ol><li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Stand-on vessel MUST hold course and speed (17(a)(i))</li><li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Stand-on vessel MAY take action if give-way isn't acting (17(a)(ii))</li><li><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Stand-on vessel MUST take action when collision is imminent (17(b))</li></ol>This progression from "must hold" to "may act" to "must act" is critical for exams!</div>`

(November Charlie);(g) A signal consisting of a square flag having above or below it a ball or anything resembling a ball;(h) Flames on the vessel (as from a burning tar barrel, oil barrel, etc.);(i) A rocket parachute flare or a hand flare showing a red light;(j) A smoke signal giving off orange-coloured smoke;(k) Slowly and repeatedly raising and lowering arms outstretched to each side;(l) A distress alert by means of digital selective calling (DSC) transmitted on: VHF channel 70, or MF/HF on the frequencies 2187.5 kHz, 8414.5 kHz, or any other available DSC frequency;(m) A ship-to-shore distress alert transmitted by the ship's Inmarsat or other mobile satellite service provider ship earth station;(n) Signals transmitted by emergency position-indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs);(o) Approved signals transmitted by radiocommunication systems, including survival craft radar transponders.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words — All 15 Distress Signals Explained:</strong><ol><li>🔫 <strong>Gunfire:</strong> Firing a gun or explosive about once per minute</li><li>📢 <strong>Continuous fog signal:</strong> Non-stop blasting of the horn</li><li>🎆 <strong>Red star rockets:</strong> Red star flares shot one at a time</li><li>📡 <strong>SOS:</strong> Three dots, three dashes, three dots (• • • — — — • • •) by any method</li><li>📻 <strong>MAYDAY:</strong> Saying "Mayday, Mayday, Mayday" on the radio</li><li>🏴 <strong>N.C. flags:</strong> Flying the November and Charlie signal flags together</li><li>🚩 <strong>Square flag + ball:</strong> A square flag with a round ball above or below it</li><li>🔥 <strong>Flames:</strong> An actual fire on the vessel (like a burning barrel)</li><li>🔴 <strong>Red flares:</strong> Rocket parachute flares or hand flares showing red light</li><li>🟠 <strong>Orange smoke:</strong> A smoke signal making orange-colored smoke (daytime signal)</li><li>🙋 <strong>Arm waving:</strong> Slowly raising and lowering arms stretched out to the sides</li><li>📟 <strong>DSC alert:</strong> Digital distress call on VHF Ch.70 or MF/HF DSC frequencies</li><li>🛰️ <strong>Satellite alert:</strong> Distress signal through Inmarsat or satellite</li><li>📍 <strong>EPIRB:</strong> Activating the Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon</li><li>📡 <strong>SART/Radio:</strong> Survival craft radar transponder or other approved radio signal</li></ol></div><h4>2. Prohibition – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">The use or exhibition of any of the foregoing signals except for the purpose of indicating distress and need of assistance and the use of other signals which may be confused with any of the above signals is prohibited.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> NEVER use distress signals unless you are actually in distress. Using them as a joke, to get attention, or by accident is illegal. Also, don't use any signal that could be mistaken for a distress signal.</div><h4>3. Additional Signals – Official Text:</h4><div class="official">Attention is drawn to the relevant sections of the International Code of Signals, the IAMSAR Manual, and the following signals:(a) A piece of orange-coloured canvas with a black square and circle or other appropriate symbol;(b) A dye marker.</div><div class="simple">🗣️ <strong>In Simple Words:</strong> For aircraft to spot you, you can also use: an orange canvas panel with a big black square and circle on it (for visibility from the air), or a sea dye marker that colors the water around you so aircraft can spot you more easily.</div><div class="kp"><strong>⚠️ Legal Obligation:</strong> Under international law (SOLAS and COLREGS), if you see or receive a distress signal, you MUST proceed to assist the vessel in distress — unless you would put your own vessel, crew, and passengers in serious danger by doing so. Failure to render assistance is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions.</div>`
